Telegram Utility Bot

Overview

This project is a Telegram bot built on the Base network, designed to bring real utility to the onchain economy. The bot enables users to seamlessly purchase airtime, data, electricity, and pay utility bills directly from Telegram. Additionally, it allows users to send tokens using Base names and Telegram usernames, simplifying the crypto transfer process.

Features

    •	Utility Payments: Users can buy airtime, data, electricity, and other utility bills directly within the Telegram app.
    •	Token Transfers: Easily send tokens to other users using simple identifiers like Base names and Telegram usernames.
    •	Smart Accounts: Implementation of smart accounts that streamline gas payments, allowing for gasless transactions.
    •	Bypassing Restrictions: Overcomes ISP bans and VPN issues that typically block access to smart wallets, ensuring accessibility for users in regions like Nigeria.

Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from a deep connection to the challenges faced by communities in Nigeria, where access to essential services and financial inclusion can be limited. By building utility-driven dApps that integrate blockchain technology into everyday life, we aim to empower users to leverage crypto for practical needs.

Challenges Addressed

    •	ISP Bans and VPN Restrictions: The project addresses challenges posed by ISP restrictions that block access to smart wallets, particularly in Nigeria.
    •	User Adoption and Education: Building educational materials and organizing community workshops to encourage adoption and demonstrate the bot’s functionality.

Technical Hurdles

Integration with the Base Network

    •	Challenge: Understanding the intricacies of the Base network and integrating it with the Telegram bot.
    •	Solution: Extensive study of the Base network’s documentation and engagement with the developer community for support.

Implementing Paymaster Functionality

    •	Challenge: Adapting the Paymaster feature, originally designed for smart wallets, to work with smart accounts.
    •	Solution: In-depth research and the development of an abstract form of smart accounts that mimic smart wallet functionality, allowing users to enjoy gasless transactions.

Non-Technical Hurdles

Navigating User Needs

    •	Challenge: Convincing users to adopt blockchain technology in their daily transactions.
    •	Solution: Creating educational materials and conducting community workshops to build confidence and engagement.

Conclusion

This Telegram bot project aims to make blockchain technology accessible and useful for everyday tasks while empowering users to seamlessly access essential services. By addressing both technical and non-technical challenges, we are committed to driving adoption of blockchain technology in underserved markets and enhancing user experiences in the onchain economy.

Future Work

    •	Continual improvements to the bot’s features based on user feedback.
    •	Expanding educational initiatives to reach more users and enhance understanding of blockchain technology.
